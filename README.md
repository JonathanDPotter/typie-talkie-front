# Typie-Talkie

This is the front-end for my typie-talkie app.  It is a simple app that I made to learn to use websockets.  The app is hosted on vercel [here](https://typie-talkie-front.vercel.app/), and the back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/typie-talkie-back).

## Technologies Used

This app is written in react with typescript. I use the react context api for global state management, axios for api calls, socket.io for real-time messaging, fontawesome icons and SASS for styling.

## Functionality

The user must register a username and password to log in and enter the chat room (there is only one). The Server will announce when a user has joined, and the user can then enter messages that will be seen by all other users. A list of active users is visible at the top right of the page.

If you want to avoid registering to test the app, you can use one of the easy login buttons to log in as a test user.
